# Fauna Sample App

This example application demonstrates how to build a real-world application with Fauna and Next.js. Fauna is a globally distributed serverless database designed to combine the flexibility of NoSQL systems with the relational query and ACID consistency of SQL databases.

Delivered as a secure and scalable cloud API, Fauna stores data close to your user (on the Edge), auto-scales and can connect to any applications over HTTPS.
This example application is a multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace (similar to Etsy).
